            <h1>About F1</h1>
            <p>
                Formula One, also called F1 in short, is an international auto racing sport. F1 is the highest level of single-seat,open-wheel and 
                open-cockpit professional motor racing contest.
                Formula One racing is governed and sanctioned by a world body called the FIA − Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile or 
                the International Automobile Federation. The name ‘Formula’ comes from the set of rules that the participating cars and drivers must follow.
            </p>
            <p>
                The objective of a Formula 1 contest is to determine the winner of a race. The driver who crosses the finish line first after 
                completing a pre-determined number of laps is declared the winner.
            </p>
            <h1>History</h1>
            <p>
                The Formula One series originated with the European Championship of Grand Prix motor racing (q.v. for pre-1947 history) of the 1920s and 1930s. 
                The formula consists of a set of rules that all participants' cars must meet. Formula One was a new formula agreed upon during 1946 after 
                World War II, with the first non-championship races taking place that year. The first Formula 1 race was the 1946 Turin Grand Prix. 
                A number of Grand Prix racing organisations had laid out rules for a world championship before the war, but due to the suspension of 
                racing during the conflict, the World Drivers' Championship did not become formalised until 1947. The first world championship race 
                took place at Silverstone in the United Kingdom in 1950. A championship for constructors followed in 1958. National championships existed
                in South Africa and the UK in the 1960s and 1970s. Non-championship Formula One events were held by promoters for many years, but due to 
                the increasing cost of competition, the last of these occurred in 1983.
                <p>
                    After a hiatus in European motor racing brought about by the outbreak of World War II in Europe in 1939, the Italian Giuseppe Farina in his Alfa Romeo won the
                     first World Championship for Drivers in 1950, narrowly defeating his Argentine teammate Juan Manuel Fangio. However, Fangio won the title in 1951, 1954, 1955, 
                     1956, and 1957 (his record of five World Championship titles stood for 45 years until German driver Michael Schumacher took his sixth title in 2003). Fangio's 
                     streak was interrupted (after an injury) by two-time champion Alberto Ascari of Ferrari. Although the UK's Stirling Moss was able to compete regularly, he was
                      never able to win the world championship and is now widely considered[by whom?] statistically to be the greatest driver never to have won the title. In a 
                      seven-year span between 1955 and 1961, Moss finished as championship runner-up four times and in third place the other three times.[11][12] Fangio, however, 
                      has a reputation for dominating Formula One's first decade and has long been considered[by whom?] the "Grand Master" of Formula One.
